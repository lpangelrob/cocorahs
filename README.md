cocorahs

Interesting CoCoRaHS-related stuff here.

_cocorahs.py_ is a procedural function that helps me when 
I'm measuring snow and ice (and a lot of liquid) by weight on my
kitchen scale. As it turns out, it's really easy to screw up
(x - 462) / 197 if you do it enough times.

Just for fun I might try web-enabling this, to see how various Python
web frameworks work.
